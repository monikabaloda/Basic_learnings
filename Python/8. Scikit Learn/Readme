scikit learn is the main library used for machine learning analysis in python. Almost all the important methods from regression to classification problems are 
housed in this library. 

This folder contains my python program that I wrote as a part of learning scikit learn in python. Majority of it comes from STAT206 : Statistical Comptuting course, 
a graduate level course offered by Department of Statistics, University of California, Riverside.
