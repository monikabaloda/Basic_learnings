This folder contains my introductory coding files which I wrote when I started learning python.  

I upload python notebook which contains python codes implementing the given concept on small problem. I formally did a course STAT206: Statistical Computing in python 
at graduate level offered by the Department of Statistics, University of California, Riverside. 

The topics that I uploaded here are: 

1. Python Functions and Basic python objects 

2. NumPy : usefule for algebra and numerical computations. 

3. Pandas: Deals with dataframes, their manipulation and transformation. 

4. Graphics: Graphs, plots, data visualization. 

5. EDA and Data Wrangling: Data cleaning, transformation and exloratory data analysis. 

6. Statistical Computing: normalization or scaling, optimization, simulation. 

7. scikit learn : machine learning library in python 

8. Teaching Python: I'm also a teaching assistant at the department of statistics at UC Riverside. I taught some of the python topics to my students. 

I'm at the learning stage at this point, therefore the programs given here may have error, please feel free to correct me. You can write your feedbacks to me at
