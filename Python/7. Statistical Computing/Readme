In this folder, we mainly include the following topics: 

1. Scaling or Normalization : In order to do a smooth analysis, sometimes we need to rescale variables on the same scale so that we can compare them.
           For example, in Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we need rescale the data so that the contribution of each variable in distance caluclation 
           does not depend on the scale of variable. 

2. Optimization : In this part, we learn how to get the points which can optimize the given objective function. We apply it in the context of least squares. 

3. Simulation : we create a model with known population parameter. Then we estimate parameters using least squares method. We then assess the accuracy of the estimates.
