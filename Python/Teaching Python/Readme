In this folder, I list down some of my Python notes that I used for teaching the undergraduate students at Univeristy of California, Riverside as teaching assistant. 
I didn't teach a full course on python, therefore the notes here may not cover contents of a usual python course. Our focus was data visualization in python.

The following points contains brief description: 

1. Python3 : Whats new, comparing Python with R and other language.
2. First program: How to write first program in python. 
3. Variable and Arithmatic : How to store variables and do basic arithmatic.
4. Graphics : Describes the plots and graphs with python codes and example plots.
