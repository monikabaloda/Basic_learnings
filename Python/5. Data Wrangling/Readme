This folder contains my python programs related to data wrangling which includes data cleaning, transformation and modifying so that it gets ready to do analysis upon.
I wrote these programs as a part of learning python. Majority of it comes from STAT206 : Statistical Comptuting course, a graduate level course offered by 
Department of Statistics, University of California, Riverside.
