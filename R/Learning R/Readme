In this section, I upload the R codes I learned one concept at a time. 
The level of these codes are moderate level and shows my initial tryst with R.
My typical learning looks like use of R functions in solving some questions made out of inbuilt datasets in R.  
Considerable amount of these codes are submitted as homeworks of graduate level courses offered at Univeristy of California, Riverside.
