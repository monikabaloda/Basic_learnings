In this R-markdown, we evaluate different models and then comapre them to select the best performing model. 
We use  the `Boston` data set contains housing values in suburbs of Boston.

We upload rendered PDF and original R coded written in R-markdown file.

      1. Validation set approach 
      
      2. Forward selection method of variable selection 
      
      3. Cross-validation (CV) approach

      1. Polynomial Regression and Generalized Additive Models (GAMS)
      
      2. Model selection using least test error rate.
