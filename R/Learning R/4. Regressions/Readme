In this R-markdown, I do basic regressions with theory.  also show some visualizations and data cleaning steps before jumping to regressions. 
Main steps done in this exercise can be put in the following points: 

  1.  Population regression line vs least squares regression line
  
  
  2.  Estimating the coefficients $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ 
  
  
  3.  Assess accuracy of the regression model
  
  
  4.  The R-squared statistics
  
  
  5. Simulations of least squares regression
