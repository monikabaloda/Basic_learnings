Tidyverse is an advanced package used for data visualization in R. It gives user far better control than Base R. 

This R-markdown file uses tidyverse package in R to do data visualization exercise. In particular, it does the following: 

Part I :  We use earthquake data `quakes` of R to visualize it 

  1. Plotting the distribution of earthquake magnitudes using tidyverse. In particular, we plot 
     i) histogram  ii) boxplot   iii) empirical cdf  iv)Q-Q plot. 
     
  2. We plot earthquakes point on top of a map layer.



Part II : We use `mpg` dataset to use cool visualization functions of tidyverse

   1. Aesthetic mapping of `color`
   
   2. Different type of smoothing curves and colored points using group identity of a variable. 
   
   3. Using _Facets_ function to add additional variable(s) to a 2D plot.
   
   4. Playing with `stat` function.
   
   5. Position adjustment options for `geom_bar()
