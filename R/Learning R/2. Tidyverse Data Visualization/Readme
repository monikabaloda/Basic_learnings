Tidyverse is an advanced package used for data visualization in R. It gives user far better control than Base R. 

I upload both rendered PDF file of this learning exercise and R-markdown file. 

If you want to have a look at my work, please open PDF file. If you want to use codes given here, use R-markdown file. 

This R-markdown file uses tidyverse package in R to do data visualization exercise. In particular, it does the following: 

***Part I : Using `dimond` price dataset, we use some advance plots***

   1. Heatmaps and Changing colors of heatmap
   
   2. Histogram, Boxplot, Frequency Polygon, and Violin plots of tidyverse.


***Part II :  We use earthquake data `quakes` of R to visualize it***. 

  1. Plotting the distribution of earthquake magnitudes using tidyverse. In particular, we plot 
     i) histogram  ii) boxplot   iii) empirical cdf  iv)Q-Q plot. 
     
  2. We plot earthquakes point on top of a map layer.



***Part III : We use `mpg` dataset to use cool visualization functions of tidyverse*** 

   1. Aesthetic mapping of `color`
   
   2. Different type of smoothing curves and colored points using group identity of a variable. 
   
   3. Using _Facets_ function to add additional variable(s) to a 2D plot.
   
   4. Playing with `stat` function.
   
   5. Position adjustment options for `geom_bar()
   
   
***Part IV : In-depth visualization of `mpg` dataset*** 

   1. Barplot, Coxcomb, Pie Charts 
   
   2. How highway mileage varies across drive train type : ordered median and coordination flips to compare.
