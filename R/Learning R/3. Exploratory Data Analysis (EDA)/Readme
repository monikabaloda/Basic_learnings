This R-markdown does exploratory data analysis (EDA). 
We use `nycflights13` datset, a built-in R dataset contains information on all 336,776 flights that departed from New York City in 2013. 
The data comes from the [US Bureau of Transportation Statistics](http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DatabaseInfo.asp?DB_ID=120&Link=0).

In this EDA, we do the followings: 

 1. Filtering observations using specific conditions using `filter()` function
     i) Single condition     ii) Multiple 'OR' condition  iii) Multiple 'AND' condition
     
 
 2. Ranking manipulation of dataset e.g. ordering using `arrange()` function 
 
 
 3. Selection of variables by their names using `select()` function


 4. Creating new variables with functions of existing variables using `mutate()` function
 
 
 5. Dealing with time zone differences as well as the daylight saving time (DST).
 
 
 6. Calculating group-wise summaries - combine `summarise()` and `group_by()`
 
 
 7. Finding best/worst flights considering issues of outliers and missing values. 
 

 8. Pattern recognization using multiple functions discussed above.
